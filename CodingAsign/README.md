## What Are Perceptrons?

Perceptrons are the building blocks of neural networks. They are simple yet powerful models that have paved the way for modern deep learning techniques. This assignment will demystify perceptrons, their architecture, and their role in solving complex problems in various domains.

## Assignment Overview

Throughout this assignment, you will:

- Learn the theory behind perceptrons and how they function.
- Explore practical examples and applications of perceptrons.
- Engage in hands-on exercises to solidify your understanding.
- Have the opportunity to test your knowledge through interactive homework assignments.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository contains all the resources you need to complete the assignment successfully. You will be working mostly in the file `perceptron_introduction.ipynb`, but feel free to poke around the other files as well, you will actually need to look through the source code to answer some of the questions.

We're excited to embark on this learning journey with you as you explore the fascinating world of perceptrons!

Happy learning!
